%h1 About Chana Rally
%p One in 6 couples experience infertility; please help us to face their fertility challenge together.

%p Many in the Jewish community are affected, often dealing with their situation in silence and alone. Chana is there to help navigate the many couples affected by the trauma of infertility so that they are no longer facing these challenges in silence and isolation.

%p Chana, a registered UK charity, supports couples experiencing infertility. 1 in 6 couples experience infertility and couples in the Jewish community are no different. Chana is here to help and to ensure that no one is left to deal with their situation alone without any support.

%p Chana provides confidential one to one and couples counselling, professional male and female support workers, a strictly confidential helpline, specialist medical support and information, an expert medical advisory panel, Information events and much more.

%p Crucially, in todayâ€™s climate of reduced and sometimes non-existent treatments available on the NHS, Chana also provides funding for fertility treatments. The charity relies totally on private donations. Since Chana was established 20 years ago, we are delighted that Chana has helped to bring 595 babies into the world.
